<h1>The Best Movies According to Ken</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>I saw this movie when I was 14 years old and it really had an impact on me. My interests changed immediately!</p>

<h3>Blade Runner</h3>
<p>This was another movie that had a profound impact on me when I was young. I even started dressing in a similar manner to the lead character (my best friend did too!)</p>

<h3>Captain America: The First Avenger</h3>
<p>This is probably my favorite of the "super hero movies". It didn't have the same impact as my first two selections (probably because I saw it when I was older), but it is still one of my favorite movies.</p>
